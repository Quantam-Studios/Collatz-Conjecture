# What is This Project?
I created this project to act as a collection of Collatz Conjecture implementations in various languages because I think that it is a simple problem to solve when learning the syntax of a new language. 

# What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture states that for any positive integer if a couple of basic rules are followed then it will always result in 1.

# What is the Algorithm?
Let n be a positive integer. If n mod 2 is equal to 0 then it is even and should have the operation n / 2 applied. If n mod 2 is not equal to 0 then it is odd and should the operation 3n + 1 applied. Continue this process until the number reaches 1.
